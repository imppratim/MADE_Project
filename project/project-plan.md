Analyzing the Impact of Weather on Traffic Collision Dynamics in Los Angeles

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->

What is the correlation between weather conditions and traffic collisions in Los Angeles from January to June 2020, and how do weather factors impact traffic collisions?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->

This study aims to explore the relationship between weather conditions and road collisions in Los Angeles, focusing on identifying significant correlations between daily weather factorsâ€”such as temperature, humidity, visibility, and wind speed, frequency of traffic accidents from January to June 2020. By uncovering these connections, the research seeks to provide valuable insights for city planners and public safety officials, enabling the development of strategies to enhance road safety and mitigate weather-related accidents. Utilizing statistical analysis and data visualization techniques, the study will uncover patterns and trends, offering a comprehensive perspective on how weather influences road safety in Los Angeles.

## Datasources

##Datasource 1: Traffic Collision Data

### Metadata URL: https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Traffic-Collision-Data-from-2010-to-Present/d5tf-ez2w/about_data

### Data URL: https://data.lacity.org/resource/d5tf-ez2w.csv

Data Type: CSV
Description: The traffic collision data, sourced from the Los Angeles City Open Data Portal, provides detailed records of reported traffic incidents in Los Angeles from 2010 to the present. This dataset includes crucial information such as the date, time, and location of each collision, as well as factors related to crash severity, causes, and any injuries or fatalities involved. For this study, the dataset will be filtered to include only incidents from January to June 2020, aligning with the weather data. We need an account to download or fetch data more than 1000 and for that reason we have used a separate function sue to the row limit.

#Datasource 2: Weather data

### Metadata URL: https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-data/weather-data-documentation/

### Data URL: https://weather.visualcrossing.com/VisualCrossingWebServices/rest/services/retrievebulkdataset?&key=NGNV4J2JDYHQS2AT24WRV28NH&taskId=aae51ed3104c7803e597cd073839ce9b&zip=false

Data Type: CSV
Description: The weather data, obtained from Visual Crossing, provides historical weather information for Los Angeles, covering various meteorological parameters such as temperature, precipitation, visibility, wind speed, and humidity. This dataset is available on a daily basis and includes comprehensive records necessary to analyze environmental conditions. For this study, weather data from January to June 2020 will be used to match the traffic collision data timeframe, allowing for a detailed examination of how specific weather conditions correlate with road crashes.
