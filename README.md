## Main Question
The main question is: What is the correlation between weather conditions and traffic collisions in Los Angeles from January to June 2020, and how do weather factors impact traffic collisions?

# Description
The study examines whether daily weather variables—such as temperature, humidity, visibility, and wind speed—are correlated with traffic accidents. By understanding these potential connections, the study aims to provide valuable insights for city planners, traffic managers, and public safety officials to enhance road safety and reduce the risk of weather-related collisions
